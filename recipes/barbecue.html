    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A barbecue (often shortened to BBQ) is a method of cooking food, typically meat, using a grill or open fire, often over charcoal or wood. It's also a social gathering where such food is served. </p>
    <p>The term can refer to the cooking method, the food itself, the grill or pit used, or the event itself. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup chile sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup rum</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 ½ hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position the grate 4 inches above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.e</li>
    </ol>
